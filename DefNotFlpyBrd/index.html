<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
Based on the popular game flappy bird, it incorporates two levels that each feature different types of obsticles and challenges.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? - Incorporated the game states, ability to restart the game on death and procedural generation of pipe placement, pipe height, pipe momentum and more to make the game challenging on each play through. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? - Game states, restarting games, making different game modes (dropped for time's sake) Had trouble expanding the game with additional game states, and the second level could not be triggered without crashing or causing the first level to not be loaded.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? - Making multiple units move in unison and despawning and respawning them in synced motion to a new location for a seamless endless experience.
