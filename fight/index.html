<h2>First Platformer</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is original work but pulls the basic aspects and mechanics from many traditional and classical games.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Fluid animation and live tracking of health values. Both players can simultaniously play without input delay or lag between player characters.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned the basics of animation manipulation as well as keyboard binding. I learned how to properly setup animation cycles to avoid overriding previous animations or overlapping animations. The prototype allowed me to gate health loss per attack instead of being a constant update cycle and also understand collision detection in Phaser.
I had the hardest time debugging as there were many more aspects to test between updates than the previous game. I had spent quite a long time trying to fix animation cycles overlapping because of this. The easiest part was getting the initial loading and playing of basic animations without interaction.
