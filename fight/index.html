<h2>First Platformer</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a derivative work based on a phaser tutorial with included features such as falling platforms and game ending on collecting all diamonds.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? - Demonstrates basic physics where platforms will fall away when stepped on by the player character.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? - Basic setup of phaser as well as utilizing physics, graphics, scaling, and animations.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? - The easiest part was setting up the game state after everything was loaded. The hardest part for me was getting the physics to behave correctly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect all diamonds on the play field to achieve win state while avoiding making it impossible win by knocking away the platforms.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
It is a mario-like platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Different ways that game objects interact with each other, keeping track of game states and ending the game, as well as learning how to control a character in a 2D setting.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
An easy platformer that anyone can experience while providing an easy puzzle as a form of challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game is a basic puzzle platformer, based on the example tutorial. The character is controlled using the left arrow to move left, right arrow to move right, and the up arrow to jump. The goal is to navigate the map and collect all of the diamonds on the map, while reacting to and avoiding non-stationary platforms. Some future inclusions could include enemy with AI, different forms of map hazards besides falling floors, different forms of collectibles, and a clock to see who can beat the game the fastest.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Plotting and navigating the map at different rates and routes to see minimize time to clear the game on time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
It is an abstract game, lacking a storyline. However it does feature the star from Mario as a reference to one of the classical platformers.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Computer Science professors
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Approximately a minute
